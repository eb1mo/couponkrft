i want to make a coupon management system website. the website will have 2 sides, admin & user. user doesn't need to register & login but admin has to. the admin registers & then logs in. once login, he doesn't have to enter the password again as the website will utilize php sessions. the admin has a dashboard from where he can view all the coupon in table form & goto create coupons page to create coupons. he can set custom prefix, no. of digits & option which allows him to generate multiple coupons at once serially or randomly. the coupon can me made single use or multiple use. he also has option to delete or edit the coupon & also set coupon expiry. The coupons & all details generated has to be admin specific i.e coupon created by admin1 should be visible to only admin1 in his dashboard. Website has a index page that binds all the pages using navbar & it is the place where the user can enter the coupon number, if the coupon is valid, he gets a random discount between the limits set by admin at the time of creating a coupon. Implement this using php. you can use bootstrap 5 to make the system more nice & responsive. remember that this is a system i.e all files must work together. give me the complete codes of each file required along with sql to make database.  the database name should be coupon_system_pro. Follow best practices while implementing this & perform all required validations.
